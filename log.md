# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 with Francisco Baptista

![alt text](computer-map.jpg "Coding Expedition!")


Hello world! Welcome to the explorer's journal of my 100 days expedition into the dreaded Codelands. This log will contain the records of my sucesses (hopefully a handful of these), failures (probably a lot of these) and all the hardwork and learning needed to make the previous a reality (definetly tons of these).

Full disclaimer: this is not my first journey into those shoalwaters, but my first time around, with all the confidence of the ignorant I came woefully unprepared. This time, having retreated to lick my wounds and prepare my campaign plan, I come - probably not ready - but more equipped to explore a bit fu 	rther than last time.
With the wonderful tools of community-building (and accompanying peer-pressure), forward-planning and commitment I plan to finish this round of coding at least one hour every day for 100 days.

Working full-time and studying at college make finding time to code a challenge in itself, but by setting clear goals and actionable milestones in-between I plan to boldly go where I've never been before.

**TL;DR: One man and one IDE enter, only one comes out! Welcome to the Codedome!**

### Day 2: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some final touches to my personal portfolio, including a photo of me, links to my work and a few typos fixed. Published it on github pages.


**Link(s) to work** 
1. Multilingual support dev branch (https://chicobaptista.github.io)
2. Dev branch with all new features included (https://github.com/chicobaptista/chicobaptista.github.io/tree/Develop)


### Day 1: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished some css improvements and a multilingual jQuery support for my portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Using git to track feature development proved to be a brillient idea. On other news, asked StackOverflow about a jQuery issue that was bugging me for weeks and one of the first answers was 'did you use console.logging to try and figure out exactly where the issue is?' Of course I didn't and using the chrome developer tools (ctrl+shift+i) revealed that the jQuery link I was calling on my html was a slimified version, which didn't support the getJSON() method my script was using. So: (a) StackOverflow is full of helpful and amazing people and (b) use the damn console!

**Link(s) to work** 
1. Multilingual support dev branch (https://github.com/chicobaptista/chicobaptista.github.io/tree/feature-multilingual)
2. Basic CSS color palette and typefaces dev branch (https://github.com/chicobaptista/chicobaptista.github.io/tree/feature-ColorFonts)
3. Dev branch with all new features included (https://github.com/chicobaptista/chicobaptista.github.io/tree/Develop)


### Day 0: April 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup the Log and github repo.

**Thoughts:** Getting ready to start a new attempt @ the 100days of code challenge. The first time I tried this challenge I just posted every day my progress on Twitter, but quickly lost track of things specially when the inevitable off-days started accumulating. I was planning on building a proper log, when, perusing the 100 Days of Code Challenge official page I found out that there was a log template all along! Pro-tip: read the documentation for a new project before jumping in folks.
