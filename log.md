# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 with Francisco Baptista

![alt text](computer-map.jpg "Coding Expedition!")


Hello world! Welcome to the explorer's journal of my 100 days expedition into the dreaded Codelands. This log will contain the records of my sucesses (hopefully a handful of these), failures (probably a lot of these) and all the hardwork and learning needed to make the previous a reality (definetly tons of these).

Full disclaimer: this is not my first journey into those shoalwaters, but my first time around, with all the confidence of the ignorant I came woefully unprepared. This time, having retreated to lick my wounds and prepare my campaign plan, I come - probably not ready - but more equipped to explore a bit fu 	rther than last time.
With the wonderful tools of community-building (and accompanying peer-pressure), forward-planning and commitment I plan to finish this round of coding at least one hour every day for 100 days.

Working full-time and studying at college make finding time to code a challenge in itself, but by setting clear goals and actionable milestones in-between I plan to boldly go where I've never been before.

**TL;DR: One man and one IDE enter, only one comes out! Welcome to the Codedome!**

[ ] An AndroidApp to help organize my board game collection


### Day 0: April 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup the Log and github repo.

**Thoughts:** Getting ready to start a new attempt @ the 100days of code challenge. The first time I tried this challenge I just posted every day my progress on Twitter, but quickly lost track of things specially when the inevitable off-days started accumulating. I was planning on building a proper log, when, perusing the 100 Days of Code Challenge official page I found out that there was a log template all along! Pro-tip: read the documentation for a new project before jumping in folks.
